# Zomato-data-analysis
 As a consultant data analyst for Zomato, I have identified strategic imperatives for opening new restaurants. Market segmentation is crucial as it tailors services to cater to diverse customer preferences, enhancing success across various locations. By leveraging location data, high-demand yet low-competition areas can be pinpointed, ensuring optimal visibility and foot traffic. Insightful analysis of Zomato customer feedback informs both menu development and operational enhancements, which significantly elevate the dining experience. Additionally, a comprehensive expansion plan is essential, integrating sustainable practices and offering diverse menus to adapt to evolving customer tastes.
